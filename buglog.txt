Checkpoint 1:

1) 

Bug: The code would continue to bootloop even though gdt was initalized correctly

Fix: Had to comment out the function that would run tests

2)

Bug: RTC and keyboard interrupt handlers only ran once

Fix: Needed to have assembly linkage around handlers to properly call `iret`

3)

Bug: RTC interrupt handler only ran once still

Fix: Didn't fully read RTC documentation, forgot to read from C register in handler

4)

Bug: EOI to a device on slave PIC wasn't working

Fix: Forgot to send EOI to master PIC as well in `send_eoi` function

5)

Bug: Bootlooping on devel

Fix: Missing paranthesis around definition

6)

Bug: Print statements crashed devel/info mem only showing one entry

Fix: Had to enable the page table for video memory
